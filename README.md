**CivicBridge AI** is an opportunity-intelligence platform for Indian citizens. It helps students, job seekers, founders, farmers, and families discover scholarships, internships, welfare schemes, and grants — then guides them with eligibility checks, document explanations, application roadmaps, and deadline tracking.

> Eligibility and AI guidance are **advisory**. Always confirm details and submit applications on the **official government portal**.

## Why CivicBridge?

Government opportunity discovery is fragmented across dozens of portals. Citizens often miss deadlines, upload the wrong documents, or fall for unofficial middlemen.

CivicBridge brings the journey into one place:

| Capability | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Verified schemes** | 40+ real central schemes with official portal links (NSP, PM-KISAN, PM-JAY, PMAY, SIH, Startup India, PMKVY, and more) |
| **Smart eligibility** | Profile-based match scores with plain-language reasons |
| **Document AI** | Explains dense government notifications in clear steps |
| **Application roadmaps** | Instant step-by-step plans from official scheme processes (optional Gemini refine) |
| **Deadline calendar** | Real deadline dates across scholarships, grants, and welfare schemes |
| **Secure vault** | Store application documents (Firebase Storage when signed in) |
| **AI assistant** | Chat about schemes, documents, and next steps via Gemini |

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.11+
- Firebase project (Auth + Firestore + Storage)
- Gemini API key ([Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/))

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Snigdha-0210/CivicBridge_AI.git
cd CivicBridge_AI
```

### 2. Frontend

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in your Firebase keys in `.env.local` (never commit this file).

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 3. Backend (AI)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv

# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` to `backend/.env`, then:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```

Health check: [http://localhost:8001/health](http://localhost:8001/health)

## Environment variables

### Frontend (`.env.local`)

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` | Firebase web app config |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | FastAPI base URL (default `http://localhost:8001`) |

### Backend (`backend/.env`)

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini API key |
| `GEMINI_MODEL_PRIMARY` | Default `gemini-2.5-flash` |
| `GEMINI_MODEL_FALLBACK` | Default `gemini-2.0-flash` |

Templates: [`.env.example`](./.env.example) · [`backend/.env.example`](./backend/.env.example)

> **Security:** Real keys stay on your machine / host. They are gitignored. If a key was ever shared publicly, **rotate it** in Firebase Console and Google AI Studio.

---

## Firebase setup

1. Create a Firebase project and a Web app  
2. **Authentication** → enable Email/Password and Google  
3. Create a **Firestore** database → paste [`firestore.rules`](./firestore.rules)  
4. Create a **Storage** bucket → paste [`storage.rules`](./storage.rules)  
5. Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains → keep `localhost`
